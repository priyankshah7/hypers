hypers provides a data structure in python for hyperspectral data. The data structure includes:

+ Tools for processing and exploratory analysis of hyperspectral data
+ Interactive hyperspectral viewer (using PyQt) that can be accessed as a method from the object
+ Allows for unsupervised machine learning directly on the object

The data structure is built on top of the numpy `ndarray`, and this package simply adds additional functionality that 
allows for quick analysis of hyperspectral data. Importantly, this means that the object can still be used as a 
normal numpy array.

**Please note that this package is currently in pre-release. It can still be used, however there is likely to be 
significant changes to the API. The first public release will be v0.1.0.**

## Features
Features implemented in ``hypers`` include:

+ Clustering
+ Decomposition (e.g. PCA, ICA, NMF)
+ Hyperspectral viewer
+ Vertex component analysis
+ Gaussian mixture models

## Examples

### Hyperspectral dimensionality reduction and clustering
Below is a quick example of using some of the features of the package on a randomized hyperspectral array. 
For an example using the IndianPines dataset, see the Jupyter notebook in the [examples](/examples/indian_pines.ipynb) directory.

```python
import numpy as np
import hypers as hp

# Generating a random 4-d datasets and creating a Dataset instance
# The test datasets here has spatial dimensions (x=200, y=200, z=10) and spectral dimension (s=1024)
test_data = np.random.rand(200, 200, 10, 1024)
X = hp.array(test_data)

# Using Principal Components Analysis to reduce to first 5 components
# The variables ims, spcs are arrays of the first 5 principal components for the images, spectra respectively
ims, spcs = X.decompose.pca.calculate(n_components=5)

# Clustering using K-means (with and without applying PCA first)
# The cluster method will return the labeled image array and the spectrum for each cluster
lbls_nodecompose, spcs_nodecompose = X.cluster.kmeans.calculate(
    n_clusters=3,
    decomposed=False
)

# Clustering on only the first 5 principal components
lbls_decomposed, spcs_decomposed = X.cluster.kmeans.calculate(
    n_clusters=3,
    decomposed=True,
    pca_comps=5
)
```

### Interactive viewer
The interactive viewer can be particularly helpful for exploring a completely new dataset for the first time to get 
a feel for the type of data you are working with. An example from a coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) dataset is 
shown below:
